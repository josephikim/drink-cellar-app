# drink-cellar-app
Build and manage your personal drink cellar, create wish lists, add tasting notes and more!

## Production Mode
1. Create a .env.production file in your host directory. This file should contain values for the environment variables listed in .env.example (e.g. DB_HOST). Alternatively, you can set those environment variables directly in your host environment before starting the app.
